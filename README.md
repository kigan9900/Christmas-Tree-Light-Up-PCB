## ✨ Inspiration
Inspired by classic seasonal DIY electronics kits and tabletop holiday displays. The design was driven by three goals:
- Create a visually balanced, display-worthy PCB silhouette.  
- Keep the electronics simple and accessible for beginners.  
- Ensure the board is optimized for fabrication (clearances, solder masks, panelization-friendly).
